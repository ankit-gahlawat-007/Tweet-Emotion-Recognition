This is a project to understand the implementation of LSTM for sentiment analysis.

It is divided into the following steps:

1. Imports
2. Fetch the data
3. Tokenizer
4. Padding and truncating sequences
5. Labels
6. Create the model
7. Train the model
8. Evaluate the model

It was done with the help of the following course from coursera: https://www.coursera.org/projects/tweet-emotion-tensorflow
Project certification: https://coursera.org/share/e5aa5df67a07baae19be1488d8ed3fb3
